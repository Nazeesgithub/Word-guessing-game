Game Description
Welcome to the Fruit Guessing Game with Hangman!
This is a fun and challenging word-guessing game where you’ll test your vocabulary and guessing skills. Your goal is to guess the name of a hidden fruit, one letter at a time. But be careful—you only have a limited number of attempts before the hangman is complete!

How to Play
Objective:
Guess the name of the hidden fruit by entering one letter at a time. The fruit is represented by a series of underscores (_), with each underscore representing a letter in the word.

Difficulty Levels:
You can choose from three difficulty levels:

Easy: 8 attempts

Medium: 6 attempts

Hard: 4 attempts

Gameplay:

Enter a single letter as your guess.

If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.

If the letter is incorrect, you’ll lose one attempt, and the hangman will start to appear.

Keep guessing letters until you either guess the entire word or run out of attempts.

Winning the Game:
You win if you guess all the letters in the word before running out of attempts.

Losing the Game:
If you run out of attempts, the hangman will be completed, and the game will end. Don’t worry—you can always try again!
